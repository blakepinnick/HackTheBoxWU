# Paper Write-Up

Target: 10.10.11.143

---

## Introduction
- Target Overview: Paper is an accessible Linux machine that showcases a straightforward penetration testing scenario. It hosts an Apache server operating on ports 80 and 443, delivering HTTP and HTTPS versions of a website. The HTTP site displays a standard server page, but careful inspection of the response headers uncovers a concealed domain. This domain hosts a WordPress blog, which exhibits a security flaw that can be leveraged to access sensitive data within its draft posts. This information directs us to an additional URL, revealing an employee chat system powered by Rocketchat. Within the chat environment, a bot is present and can be interacted with to extract useful details, including a user's system password. Further exploration of the host highlights a vulnerability in the sudo configuration, which can be exploited to gain elevated root privileges.
- Objective: Gather the User and the Root flag
- Tools:tmux, nmap, burpsuite

## Initial Reconnaissance
	- Port Scanning: nmap default scan
		- Command:nmap -vv -sV -sC 10.10.11.143 >> paper.txt
		- Output: 22/ OpenSSH		80/Apache Server	443/Apache Server
	- Observations: both web servers lead to a HTTP server test page
					plugging http://10.10.11.143:80 request into burpsuite I learned that there is a wordpress server domain of "office.paper"

## Conclusion
- Summary: In the "Paper" lab (10.10.11.143), I started with an Nmap scan, spotting Apache on ports 80/443. Using Burp Suite, I found the office.paper WordPress domain (5.2.3), vulnerable to CVE-2019-17671. This let me access draft posts, revealing a Rocket.Chat link (chat.office.paper). I registered, then used the recyclops bot to extract dwight’s password (Queenofblad3s!23) from /hubot/.env, logging in via SSH. For root, I exploited Polkit with CVE-2021-3560, creating user blake (pass1) to gain root access. I grabbed the user flag (bf9dfd086e1b46bd41b354e6ebd7a14b) and root flag (a4266104b9dc9ea0d490fa51bb0cbdf7). It felt rewarding!
- Lessons Learned: Just use the premade github PoC. I tried to do the polkit vulnerability on own and wasted hours. I also wasted time by not just looking into polkit once I saw the SUID was the only one coming from a different directory. I kept messing with the chatbot seeing if I could do something with it. When the whole time I should have been looking for the polkit exploit, I could have saved myself hours there too. If an exploit is timing based... understand that it may just not be working the first couple times. I was stressing about the exploit not working, but it just had to be ran a few times to make sure the password was getting set for the account "blake" in this instance.
